# CPP_05
### Repetition and Exceptions
#### This module is designed to help you understand Try/Catch and Exceptions in CPP.

## Exercise 00:
### Mommy, when I grow up, I want to be a bureaucrat!
Let’s design an artificial nightmare of offices, corridors, forms, and waiting queues.
Sounds fun? No? Too bad.

## Exercise 01:
### Form up, maggots!
Now that you have bureaucrats, let’s give them something to do. What better activity
could there be than the one of filling out a stack of forms?

## Exercise 02:
### No, you need form 28B, not 28C...
Since you now have basic forms, it’s time to make a few more that actually do something.

## Exercise 03:
### At least this beats coffee-making
Because filling out forms is annoying enough, it would be cruel to ask our bureaucrats
to do this all day long. Fortunately, interns exist. In this exercise, you have to implement
the Intern class. The intern has no name, no grade, no unique characteristics. The only
thing the bureaucrats care about is that they do their job.
